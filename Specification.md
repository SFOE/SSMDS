# Specification
This document explains the SwissSharedMobility data exchange standard.

## Introduction
The SwissSharedMobility standard is an open data standard for Shared Mobility. The data standard aims to describe real-time data for all kind of Shared Mobilities such as bike sharing, car sharing or scooter sharing.
The suggested data standard is based on the ["General Bikeshare Feed Specification"](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md) which was designed by the "North American Bikeshar Association".

The SwissSharedMobility standard is constructed modularly. Therefore operators can introduce the data standard in stages. The following modules are available:

 * SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem
 * SwissSharedMobilityPushStation
 * SwissSharedMobilityPushStatus
