## Introduction
The SSMDS is a generic data exchange standard for all kinds of shared mobility assets such as bikes, cars or scooters as well as sharing-systems and aims to describe static and real-time data (such as availability or position).

SSMDS is inspired by the following sources:

| Source  | Scope | Ongoing development |
| --------------------- | ------------- |------------- |
|[General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/)| Public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. | |
|[General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md)| Standardized data feed for bike share system availability. | [Allow vehicle type definitions / generalize to other modes](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/pull/136) & [Improvements to GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/issues/137) |
|[Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification)| Data specifications focused on dockless e-scooters and bicycles. | [Update MDS / MDS-Provider to support multiple modes](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/pull/255) |

Unfortunately, for the time being GBFS and MDS have limited scopes: GBFS only supports bikesharing and MDS only supports dockless e-scooters and bikes. Therefore, we decided to establish a new standard, which is generic and able to support all kinds of shared mobility assets as well as systems.

## Overview

A sharing **system** provides transportation to its customers by means of shared assets (for example bicycles or cars) on an as-needed basis. A sharing system is identified by a unique systemId and described by information about the operator.

A **station** is a physical place containing assets (vehicles) of a specific sharing system. A station is described by coordinates. Every station belongs to a sharing system.

A **vehicle** is a shared mobility asset such as a bike. When its not used it belongs to a station. Every vehicle belongs to a station.

An **allowedArea** is an area...

## Entities

To address the data exchange based on the defined entities, the following services are established:

Mandatory:
 * [System](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#system)
 * [Stations](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#stations)
 * [Vehicles](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#vehicles)

Optional:
* [AllowedAreas](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#allowedareas)
* Hours (not yet available)
* Calendar (not yet available)
* Regions (not yet available)
* Pricing (not yet available)
* PushAlerts (not yet available)
* to be extended

### AllowedArea

| Name  | Data Type | M/O | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |--- |
| actionType | [actionType](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#actiontype) | M | The action that has to be performed with the provided data. |
| allowedAreaId  | String | M |  Identifier for the allowed area. This should be globally unique (even between different systems) and it is currently up to the operator to guarantee uniqueness. In addition, this value is intended to remain the same over the life of the system. | 
| name  | String | O | Full name of the system to be displayed to customers. | 
| geometry | Polygon | O | A GeoJSON polygon. |

**Example in JSON**
 
 ```json

## Best practice

### Free-floating: (E)-Bikes, (E)-Cars, (E)-Scooters...
Generate a station per vehicle. The dynamic part of the data is the location of the station/vehicle (latitude, longitude).
