## Introduction
The SSMDS is a generic data exchange standard for all kinds of shared mobility assets such as bikes, cars or scooters as well as sharing-systems and aims to describe static and real-time data (such as availability or position).

SSMDS is inspired by the following sources:

| Source  | Scope | Ongoing development |
| --------------------- | ------------- |------------- |
|[General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/)| Public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. | |
|[General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md)| Standardized data feed for bike share system availability. | [Allow vehicle type definitions / generalize to other modes](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/pull/136) & [Improvements to GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/issues/137) |
|[Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification)| Data specifications focused on dockless e-scooters and bicycles. | [Update MDS / MDS-Provider to support multiple modes](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification/pull/255) |

Unfortunately, for the time being GBFS and MDS have limited scopes: GBFS only supports bikesharing and MDS only supports dockless e-scooters and bikes. Therefore, we decided to establish a new standard, which is generic and able to support all kinds of shared mobility assets as well as systems.

## Overview

A sharing **system** provides transportation to its customers by means of shared assets (for example bicycles or cars) on an as-needed basis. A sharing system is identified by a unique systemId and described by information about the operator.

A **station** is a physical place containing assets (vehicles) of a specific sharing system. A station is described by coordinates. Every station belongs to a sharing system.

A **vehicle** is a shared mobility asset such as a bike. When its not used it belongs to a station. Every vehicle belongs to a station.

## Best practice

### Free-floating: (E)-Bikes, (E)-Cars, (E)-Scooters...
Generate a station per vehicle. The dynamic part of the data is the location of the station/vehicle (latitude, longitude).
