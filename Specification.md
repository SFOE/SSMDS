## Introduction
The SwissSharedMobility standard is a data exchange standard for shared mobility assets and aims to describe static and real-time data (such as availability or position) for all kinds of shared mobilities such as bikes, cars or scooters. It consists of different individual services. Therefore operators can introduce the data exchange standard in stages. The SwissSharedMobility standard is based on the ["General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)"](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md) which was designed by the "North American Bikeshare Association".

## Overview

A sharing **system** is identified by a unique system_id and described with information about the operator.

A **station** is a place described by coordinates where vehicles are positioned. Every station belongs to a sharing system.

A **vehicle** is a shared mobility asset such as a bike. When its not used it belongs to a station. Every vehicle belongs to a station.

To address the data exchange based on the defined entities, the following services are established:

Mandatory:
 * [SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#swisssharedmobilitypushsystem)
 * [SwissSharedMobilityPushStations](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#swisssharedmobilitypushstation)
 * [SwissSharedMobilityPushVehicles](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#swisssharedmobilitypushvehicles)

Optional:
* SwissSharedMobilityPushHours (not available yet)
* SwissSharedMobilityPushCalendar (not available yet)
* SwissSharedMobilityPushRegions (not available yet)
* SwissSharedMobilityPushPricing (not available yet)
* SwissSharedMobilityPushAlerts (not available yet)
* to be extended

## Services

### SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem

SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem is a message that is sent in order to upload system data.

| Name  | Data Type | M/O | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |--- |
| actionType | [actionType](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#actiontype) | M | The action that has to be performed with the provided data. |
| system_id  | String | M |  ID field - identifier for this sharing system. This should be globally unique (even between different systems) and it is currently up to the operator to guarantee uniqueness. In addition, this value is intended to remain the same over the life of the system. | 
| language | String | M | An IETF language tag indicating the language that will be used throughout the rest of the files. This is a string that defines a single language tag only. | 
| name  | String | M  |  	Full name of the system to be displayed to customers. | 
| operator | String | O | Name of the operator of the system. |
| url | URI | O | The URL of the sharing system. The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. |
| email | String | O | A single contact email address for customers to address questions about the system. |

 **Example in JSON**
 
 ```json
{
		"actionType" : "fullLoad",
		"system_id" : "nextbike_ch",
		"language" : "de",
		"name" : "nextbike Switzerland",
		"operator" : "nextbike GmbH, Erich-Zeigner Allee 69-73, 04229 Leipzig, German",
		"url" : "https://www.nextbike.ch/xx/sursee/",
		"email" : "info@nextbike.ch"
}
```
  
 You will find an example in geoJSON [here](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Json/SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem.json).
  
 
  
### SwissSharedMobilityPushStations

SwissSharedMobilityPushStations is a message that is sent in order to upload data about the stations.

| Name  | Data Type | M/O | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --- |
| actionType | [actionType](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#actiontype) | M | The action that has to be performed with the provided data. |
| fk_system_id | String | M | Foreign key of the sharing system as defined in [SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#swisssharedmobilitypushsystem).
| stations | [station](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#station) | M | Array that contains one object per station. See below for definition of data type station. |

 
**Example in JSON**
  
 ```json
{
	"actionType" : "fullLoad",
	"fk_system_id" : "nextbike_ch",
	"stations" : {
		"station_id" : "46",
