## Introduction
The SSMDS is a data exchange standard for shared mobility assets and aims to describe static and real-time data (such as availability or position) for all kinds of shared mobilitiy assets such as bikes, cars or scooters. It consists of different individual services. Therefore operators can introduce the data exchange standard in stages.

The SwissSharedMobility standard is inspired by the following sources:

| Source  | Scope |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
|[General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/)| Public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. |
|[General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/README.md)| Status of bikesharing systems at this moment. |
|[Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/mobility-data-specification)| Data specifications focused on dockless e-scooters and bicycles. |



## Overview

A sharing **system** provides transportation to its customers by means of shared assets (for example bicycles or cars) on an as-needed basis. A sharing system is identified by a unique system_id and described with information about the operator.

A **station** is a physical place containing assets (vehicles) of a specific sharing system. A station is described by coordinates. Every station belongs to a sharing system.

A **vehicle** is a shared mobility asset such as a bike. When its not used it belongs to a station. Every vehicle belongs to a station.

### SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem

SwissSharedMobilityPushSystem is a message that is sent in order to upload system data.

| Name  | Data Type | M/O | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |--- |
| actionType | [actionType](https://github.com/SFOE/SwissSharedMobility/blob/master/Specification.md#actiontype) | M | The action that has to be performed with the provided data. |
| system_id  | String | M |  ID field - identifier for this sharing system. This should be globally unique (even between different systems) and it is currently up to the operator to guarantee uniqueness. In addition, this value is intended to remain the same over the life of the system. | 
| language | String | M | An IETF language tag indicating the language that will be used throughout the rest of the files. This is a string that defines a single language tag only. | 
| name  | String | M  |  	Full name of the system to be displayed to customers. | 
| operator | String | O | Name of the operator of the system. |
| url | URI | O | The URL of the sharing system. The value must be a fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. |
| email | String | O | A single contact email address for customers to address questions about the system. |

 **Example in JSON**
 
 ```json

## Best practice

### Free-floating: (E)-Bikes, (E)-Cars, (E)-Scooters...
Generate a station per vehicle. The dynamic part of the data is the location of the station/vehicle (latitude, longitude).
